### 2) AI-Assisted User Prioritization

**AI Prompt:**  
*"My project's value proposition is: SolSplits eliminates the friction between social discovery and DeFi execution by bringing proven DeFi operations directly into Twitter conversations, with revenue splitting capabilities for creator payments. Here is a brainstormed list of all potential user types: Content creators splitting collaboration revenue, Crypto traders executing social DeFi operations, Podcast co-hosts sharing episode payments, YouTube collaborators splitting ad revenue, NFT artists splitting royalties, Freelance developers sharing project payments, Music producers distributing track revenue, Course creators with affiliate partners, Solana protocol integrators building on DeFi infrastructure, Content consumers, Brand sponsors, Followers, Community members, Tax professionals, Legal advisors, Platform developers, Community moderators, Security auditors, Customer support, Solana ecosystem participants, Jupiter aggregator, Twitter/X platform, Creator economy platforms, Regulatory authorities, Solana validator network. Based on the value proposition, which 2-5 of these user types are the most critical to focus on for an initial Proof-of-Concept? For each user you recommend, provide a brief rationale explaining why they are essential for proving the project's core value."*

**AI Response:**  
*"For a SolSplits POC, I recommend focusing on these 3 critical user types:*

*1) **Content creators splitting collaboration revenue** - This is the primary target that validates both halves of your value proposition: social DeFi operations AND revenue splitting. They have the strongest pain point around platform switching between social discovery and payment execution, and represent the unique value proposition that no current Solana protocol offers.*

*2) **Crypto traders executing social DeFi operations** - Essential for proving the social DeFi hypothesis and demonstrating platform breadth beyond just revenue splitting. These users validate the general-purpose social DeFi capabilities and show market demand beyond the creator economy niche.*

*3) **Solana protocol integrators building on DeFi infrastructure** - Critical for technical validation as the first major revenue splitting protocol on Solana. They understand the technical landscape and can validate both the innovation (bringing 0xSplits-style functionality to Solana) and implementation quality against existing Solana standards.*

*These three users create a complete validation loop: creators prove the revenue splitting market need on Solana, traders validate social DeFi capability, and integrators validate technical innovation and protocol design quality."*

**Manual Analysis & Final Decision:**
The AI's recommendations effectively address the unique positioning of SolSplits as the first comprehensive revenue splitting protocol built natively for Solana, inspired by 0xSplits but designed for Solana's architecture and ecosystem.

**Final Prioritized User Types (Top 3 for POC):**

**1. Content creators splitting collaboration revenue** - Core user validating the primary innovation: bringing sophisticated revenue splitting to Solana

**2. Crypto traders executing social DeFi operations** - Validates social DeFi functionality and platform breadth

**3. Solana protocol integrators** - Validates technical architecture as the first major Solana-native revenue splitting infrastructure

**Decision Rationale:**
I agreed with all three AI recommendations because they create comprehensive validation of SolSplits as both a social interface innovation and the pioneering revenue splitting protocol for Solana. The protocol integrator perspective is crucial for validating our technical approach in a ecosystem that currently lacks comprehensive revenue splitting infrastructure.

## Part B: Adversarial Analysis & Refinement

### 1) Critique & Refine User Stories / Requirements

**AI Prompt:**
"Review my core user functions/stories: Content Creators need to connect wallets, create Solana-native revenue splits with advanced mechanisms, add collaborators, fund arrangements with SPL tokens, execute distributions, and track status. Crypto Traders need to execute secured swaps, check SPL token prices, view balances, send transfers, and monitor confirmations with error handling. Solana Protocol Integrators need to integrate with Solana DeFi protocols, configure Solana RPC connections, implement Solana-specific security, and deploy monitoring. And review my requirements: Twitter bot integration with validation, user registry, Jupiter DEX integration, security-first transaction system, custom Anchor smart contracts for revenue splitting, SPL token escrow mechanisms, multi-party distribution logic, advanced splitting features, multi-layer command validation, whitelisting and rate limiting, security alerts,  SPL Token Program integration, Solana RPC optimization, Anchor framework utilization, transaction fee optimization. Considering SolSplits positions as the first comprehensive revenue splitting protocol native to Solana and lessons from BANKR's command misinterpretation issues (March 2025), do these stories truly hit the mark? Are the requirements granular enough for Solana-specific implementation? What's missing or unclear?"

**AI Critique Response:**
